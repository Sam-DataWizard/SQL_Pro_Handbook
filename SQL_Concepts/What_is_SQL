Definition: 
SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is a domain-specific language used for interacting with relational databases. SQL allows users to perform various operations on data, such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting records.

Key Functions:
Querying Data: Retrieve specific information from databases using the SELECT statement.
Inserting Data: Add new records to a database with the INSERT INTO statement.
Updating Data: Modify existing records using the UPDATE statement.
Deleting Data: Remove records from a database with the DELETE statement.
Creating and Modifying Tables: Define and alter database structures with CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, and DROP TABLE.

Common SQL Statements:
SELECT: Retrieves data from one or more tables. Example: SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales';
INSERT INTO: Adds new records. Example: INSERT INTO employees (name, department) VALUES ('John Doe', 'Sales');
UPDATE: Changes existing records. Example: UPDATE employees SET department = 'Marketing' WHERE name = 'John Doe';
DELETE: Removes records. Example: DELETE FROM employees WHERE name = 'John Doe';

Why SQL Matters:
Data Management: SQL is essential for organizing and managing data in relational databases. It allows users to interact with large volumes of data efficiently.
Standardized Language: SQL is a standardized language supported by many database systems, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server. This means that once you learn SQL, you can apply it across different platforms.
Data Analysis: SQL is widely used for data analysis and reporting, making it a crucial skill for data analysts, data scientists, and business intelligence professionals.

SQL and Databases: SQL operates on relational databases, where data is organized into tables with rows and columns. Relationships between tables are established through keys, enabling complex queries and data retrieval.
